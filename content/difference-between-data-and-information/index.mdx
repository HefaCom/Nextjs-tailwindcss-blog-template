# What is Data?

Data refers to raw, unorganized facts that need to be processed. It can come in the form of numbers, stats, images, meters, measurements, survey responses - anything that captures a characteristic about a person, place, time or event. Data by itself does not relay specific meaning without interpretation. 

Some examples of data:

- Height: 5’10”  
- Age: 35
- Temperature readings  
- Census response tallies 
- Logged error codes   

On its own, data just represents observations or pieces of information. However, properly collected, organized and analyzed data provides the foundation for revealing insights.

## Qualitative Data vs Quantitative Data

We can categorize data as either qualitative or quantitative:

**Qualitative data** captures attributes about qualities – descriptive characteristics like color, shape, emotions that can’t be easily measured. Some examples:

- Color of a car: Blue  
- Customer sentiment: Happy 
- Item texture: Rough
- Focus group research   

**Quantitative data** measures objective attributes with numbers that can be counted, compared on a scale, or expressed numerically. For example:
  
- Height in feet   
- Annual revenue    
- IQ score
- Number of defected units
- Statistical metrics like mean, standard deviation etc.

Both qualitative and quantitative data offer value in understanding phenomena better. But quantitative data often lends itself easier to analysis using mathematical and statistical techniques once collected.

# How does data become information?

While raw data reflects measurements, it must be **processed and organized purposefully to become meaningful information**. 

Converting data to information involves:

1. Identifying useful data sources that capture the characteristics needing investigation – whether from internal databases and systems or external field measurements.

2. Collecting complete, accurate representative sets of data systematically over time.

3. Cleaning and standardizing data ensuring quality – fixing inconsistencies, removing noise, managing missing values. 

4. Analyzing, aggregating and arranging data to reveal patterns using statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms.

5. Interpreting analysis results in context to produce information – synthesizing numbers, trends and analytical outputs into written, visual and actionable insights.   

Meaning emerges through structured refinement – often in cycles that improve understanding incrementally with each iteration. But what tangible practices enable high grade, reliable information?

# What are the best practices for high-quality data and information?  

Treating data as a strategic asset optimizing its value requires rigor and care through its lifecycle – from collection to storage to analysis. Key principles ensuring excellence include:

**Consistent**: Collect data systematically using consistent methodology over regular intervals building comparability over time.

**Accurate**: Carefully record precise measurements with attention to detail and data integrity ensuring factual reliability.   

**Complete**: Gather comprehensive datasets capturing entire populations or representative samples avoiding partial subsets or gaps.

**Relevant**: Store pertinent attributes aligned to analysis needs not “just in case” data lacking meaningful context.

**Secure**: Manage access, privacy, backups and continuity via governance minimizing risk.

**Compliant**: Adhere to regulatory obligations around consumer data rights fully. 

**Contextualized**: Frame analysis insights relative to business issues and priorities addressing specific audiences.

**Actionable**: Translate analysis into concrete next steps and recommendations audiences can operationalize. 

**Automated**: Enable collection through IoT, APIs and infrastructure for sustainability at scale over manual processes.

Ongoing governance maximizes long term value. But how might this manifest for different functions?

# Data vs Information Examples in a Business Context  

In practice, how might data become activated into information? Consider a few business scenarios:

## Examples of Data

- **Marketing**: response rates to campaigns, clickstream web traffic behavior, hashtag impressions    
- **Support**: counts of support tickets filed weekly, customer NPS survey scores  
- **Finance**: quarterly sales totals, cost input metrics like headcount and infrastructure expenses    
- **Product**: usage telemetry tracked in software, reliability defect rates  

## Examples of Information  

- **Marketing**: Typical customer web visit length is 2-3 minutes mostly on product pages. Response rates for email campaigns have declined by 10% quarter over quarter indicating fatigue.
- **Support**: Survey results show a significant uptick in dissatisfied customers – average NPS scores dropped below industry baseline this quarter. Support ticket escalations grew 15% especially around billing disputes.   
- **Finance**: While gross sales rose 5% yearly, net profit declined by 8% driven by sizable increases in operational expenses from added headcount, expanded infrastructure costs outpacing revenue gains. 
- **Product**: Analysis indicates primary software usage occurs between 7-9AM daily toward inventory lookup workflows. However crashes spiked 18% this month during order routing procedures requiring optimization.

Converting observations into intelligence reveals actionable narratives. But simply having information is not enough – it must directly enable decisions through easy access and visibility. How might businesses extract more value?

# How can businesses harness the power of data and information?

Making information readily usable and insightful to leaders is key extracting its value. Strategies enabling data-driven organizations include:

**Automating** routine reporting through **dashboards** and **analytics apps** puts insights directly into stakeholder hands consistently without manual effort.  

**Documenting methodology** behind analyses maintains continuity for reliability and comparisons over time as personnel and systems evolve.

**Prioritizing business outcomes** for data projects over purely technical objectives accelerates value recognition.   

**Developing analytical talent** through training hones critical thinking, statistical techniques and tools competency.  

**Fostering data-driven culture** rewards sharing observations transparently without fearing consequence.  

**Measuring data ROI** quantifies how analytics contributes toward KPIs demonstrating relevance. 

**Enriching context** with external datasets augments internal observations creating a strategic marketplace advantage.
  
**Securely expanding access** enables more voices to participate asking questions without restrictions.

**Accelerating iteration velocity** ships insights faster even if rough allowing refinement over stagnating at perfection.  

With foundations around skills, technologies and culture set – the applications of quality information are vast limited only by imagination.

# Make the most of data and information in your business  

| Data 	 | Information |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| objectives observations capturing aspects of a phenomenon      | meaningful interpretations contextualizing observations relative to business issues and audience priorities |    
| quantitative and qualitative attributes about a person, place, event etc collected over time | trends, correlations, patterns, insights, narratives synthesized from analysis of data in context |
| raw facts and measurements   | actionable intelligence enabling decisions and strategy  |
| static datasets requiring processing to reveal value | dynamic asset that improves and adapts to evolving needs when governed properly |

Both data and information hold tremendous latent potential often obscured by volumes that feel overwhelming. But principles and practices around quality, utility and governance dissolve blockers unlocking immense possibility. With sound data foundations powering reliable information channels, organizations transcend workplace fragmentation toward clarity on priorities. They ask better questions, investigate unknowns confidently, adapt more readily based on evidence and align teams gracefully even during uncertainty. But none of this happens without investment establishing mature analytics capabilities first.

While daunting at the outset when still struggling with basics, the long term compounding returns from cultivated data and information mastery far outweigh the growing pains of progressing up the capability curve. But first comes accepting data’s rightful place as a definitive business asset no less vital than financial capital itself. Only with such framing does the motivation emerge to actively steward its realized potential. With CDOs and analytics leaders now sitting at boardroom strategy tables once reserved only for Finance, Marketing and Operations heads, it seems data’s prominence as a driver of competitive advantage has finally penetrated organizational psyche decades after first being dismissed as a passing fad. The vision emerging now understands world class analytics not as a bottleneck solved once in transformation projects, but rather as keystone enabler perpetually positioning organizations to outpace disruption. 

So in closing, resist any temptation to downgrade data and information to mere tracking of historical achievements when they in fact represent the seeds to inventing your future. Let that sink in. The fruits of tomorrow take root in observations harvested carefully today. And the bounty reaped exceeds present imagination if stewarded well. But first comes planting enabling conditions for such dreams to take shape. Where to begin? Start simply by writing down your 3 most important questions then work backwards methodically to what data answering them might look like. Soon you’ll find promise stirring once static statistics into lifegiving possibility breathing new trajectories forward you’d never otherwise dare ponder much less pursue without such direction. The fueled curiosities of your people await their inevitable unveiling through data. Welcome the adventure!
