R is a powerful open-source language beloved by statisticians, data analysts, scientists and ML engineers for statistical computing and graphics. But with advanced functionality comes complexity that can overwhelm beginners. **So what are the most essential concepts an R programming novice should focus on first?** Let's break it down.

<details>

### What is the basic concept of R programming?

The basic building blocks are:

- **Data types**: Numeric, character, logical 
- **Variables** and assignment 
- **Vectors/matrices**: Data structures
- **Functions**: Reusable routines 
- **Data frames**: Tabular data
- **Control flow**: Loops, conditionals
- **Visualization**: Plots, charts, dashboards

Grasp these first before diving into advanced techniques.

## Understanding R Fundamentals

R relies on unique terminology and structural conventions. Grasping fundamentals equips you to write code confidently. Key foundations include:

### Core Data Types
R supports common data types like numeric, logical, character etc:

```r
# Numeric 
x <- 10  

# Character
name <- "John"

# Logical 
is_student <- TRUE
```

Understanding how to declare and operate on these prepares for data tasks.

### Variable Assignment   
**Variables** store data values. The `<-` assignment operator assigns values:  

```r
# Assign 10 to x
x <- 10
```

Variable naming observes conventions like `lower_case_with_underscores`.

### Data Structures
**Vectors, lists, matrices and data frames** structure data. We'll focus on vectors and data frames first as primary structures for analysis.

### Control Flow
**Conditionals** like `if/else` statements direct logic flow:

```r 
if(x > 5){
  print("x exceeds 5")  
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

**Loops** like `for` and `while` repeat operations:

```r
# Print 0 through 5  
for(i in 0:5) {
  print(i) 
}
``` 

Control flow allows custom logic.

These basics equip you to start coding!

### What should I learn before learning R?  

Having beginner familiarity with general programming concepts helps tremendously. Basic literacy in variables, data types, functions, conditional logic provides context. 

Some statistical knowledge also helps operationalize analysis. But you can learn statistics alongside R!

## Exploring Important Packages

Base R delivers plenty, but **packages extend functionality immensely**. Thousands of specialized packages exist - which should beginners prioritize? 

### Tidyverse - Data Wrangling Reimagined
The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) pioneered an intuitive grammar and consistent data manipulation tools through packages like:

- **dplyr**: Data transformation
- **tidyr**: Reshaping   
- **readr/readxl**: Data import 
- **ggplot2**: Visualization
- **lubridate**: Date wrangling    
- **stringr**: String processing

Tidyverse promotes a standardized approach making analysis more accessible.

### data.table - Blazing Fast Big Data 
The [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) package provides lightning fast methods for large, high performance datasets not practical with R data frames directly. 

### RMarkdown - Dynamic Reports     
[RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) simplifies creating reproducible data reports directly from R scripts blending code, visuals and prose.

This just scratches the surface of influential packages. But focusing first on Tidyverse, data.table and RMarkdown builds firm foundations.

*Leverage packages to make analysis easier. Don't get overwhelmed trying to learn everything at once.*  

## Basic Arithmetic & Variable Assignment 

Let's put fundamentals into practice! R serves primarily as an advanced calculator. Getting comfortable with arithmetic operands prepares more complex data tasks.

Basic math works as expected:

```r
# Addition
5 + 5  

# Subtraction  
10 - 3

# Multiplication
3 * 4  

# Division 
10 / 2  

# Modulo 
9 %% 4  
```

Store results in **variables**:


```r
# Assign sum of 5 + 5 to a 
a <- 5 + 5
print(a)

# Assign 20 minus 4 to b
b <- 20 - 4 
```

The `print()` function displays objects.

Variable assignment seems trivial but is fundamental for analysis by storing intermediate values. 

*Practice arithmetic and assignment until they become second nature.*

### How can a beginner learn R programming?

Key strategies include:

- Start with online courses teaching basics 
- Break problems down into smallest parts
- Experiment in a sandbox environment  
- Read documentation for functions unfamiliar 
- Build small projects to apply skills
- Find a community for questions/discussion
- Iteratively increase challenges

Learning alongside peers accelerates growth!

## Vectors

**Vectors** store ordered collections of elements - essentially lists. They can hold numeric, character or logical values.

Create vectors with `c()`:

```r 
# Numeric vector
num_vec <- c(1, 2, 3, 4) 

# Character vector
char_vec <- c("a", "b", "c")  

# Logical
logical_vec <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)
```

Index vectors via subscript brackets like `my_vector[0]`.

Useful functions like `length()` report size:


```r
days_vec <- c("Mon", "Tues", "Wed")
length(days_vec)
#> 3 
```

Vectors serve as basic data structures for analysis. Common workflows involve:

- Subset vectors
- Assign to variables 
- Pass to functions 
- Transform

Practice core vector operations like:

```r
# Calculate mean of a numeric vector
avg <- mean(num_vec)

# Filter to only TRUES
just_true <- logical_vec[logical_vec == TRUE]

# Convert character to uppercase 
upper_chars <- toupper(char_vec)
``` 

Vectors provide a foundation for higher order data challenges.

*Tackle vectors thoroughly before moving to matrices or data frames.*


## Functions

**Functions** encapsulate reusable routines for specific tasks. You can write custom functions while leveraging R's extensive catalog of pre-made offerings.

Functions help avoid repetitive logic. Abstract manual effort into functions instead:  

```r
# Function to return product of inputs 
multiply <- function(x, y) {
  return(x * y)
}

# Call function
multiply(3, 5) 
```

`return()` sends back the result.

Similarly, extract duplicate effort into functions:


```r 
# Verbose way
print("Hello")
print("World!")

# Function extracting repeat print
greet <- function(x) {
  print(x)
}

greet("Hello")
greet("World")
```

Now you can `greet()` anything without rewrite!

Standard R functions work the same way:


```r
# Round down 3.8 
floor(3.8) 

# Return random # between 0-1
rand_num <- runif(1)
``` 

Writing functions trains decomposition and abstraction skills essential for programmers.

*Practice writing tiny functions even if R has equivalents. Develop computational thinking.*

### How long does it take to learn R as a beginner?

Expect to spend about 3-6 months with consistent practice to become comfortable with fundamentals: 

- First month exploring basics  
- Month 2-3 reinforcing with projects
- Month 4-6 diving deeper 

But growth accelerates exponentially once foundations solidify. Be patient, focus on core concepts and enablements like functions and practice deliberately. The journey brings immense intellectual reward!

</details>  

Here is the continuation of the article on data frames in R:

```r
# Data frame with player stats
players <- data.frame(
  name = c("John", "Amy", "Bob"),
  age = c(25, 30, 40),
  score = c(100, 75, 200)
)

# Print data frame
players

#         name age score
# 1      John  25   100
# 2       Amy  30    75 
# 3       Bob  40   200
```

Data frames allow column-wise access to elements instead of positionally with vectors.

Query player ages via `players$age`. Various functions extract metrics and insights:

```r  
# Sum of all scores
total_score <- sum(players$score)

# Average score 
mean(players$score)

# Filter for age > 30
over_30 <- players[players$age > 30,]

# Add player
new_player <- data.frame(name = "Liz", age = 28, score = 85) 
all_players <- rbind(players, new_player)
```

As data becomes complex, data frames provide structure benefiting analysis. Common workflows include:

- Importing external data 
- Subsetting rows/columns
- Sorting records  
- Merging multiple sets   
- Aggregating metrics

Data frames shine organizing messy data challenge. 

*When in doubt, reach for a data frame to tame disorderly data tasks.*   

## Data Visualization

"A picture is worth 1000 data points". Charts communicate insights hidden inside datasets. With over 20 built-in plot types, R delivers comprehensive graphical capabilities out-of-the-box.

Bubble plots reveal relationships clearly:

```r
 ggplot(players, aes(x = age, y = score)) +  
  geom_point(size = 4)
```



Adapt plots to evolving needs with layers:


```r
ggplot(players, aes(x = age, y = score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```



Now a linear model summarizes the age/score trend!

Internalize this visualization vocabulary:
  
- **ggplot2**: Popular visualization package 
- **ggplot()**: Constructor function  
- **Layers**: Modular additions    
- **aes()**: Mapping variables   

R viral "data art" beneifts from imaginative visualizations grounded in theory. 

*Sharpen plot prowess addressing diverse data stories.*
