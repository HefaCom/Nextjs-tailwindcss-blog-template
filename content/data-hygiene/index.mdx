# What Is Data Hygiene?

Data hygiene refers to the practices ensuring data quality throughout its full lifecycle - from capturing, storing, processing, analyzing and reporting. Like personal hygiene regarding health and cleanliness, **data hygiene reflects discipline and care taking preventing "dirty data" and enabling reliability**.

Symptoms of poor hygiene manifest in misspelled customer names, incorrect financial figures, duplicate website analytics logs, outdated product catalogs etc eroding credibility, productivity and strategic decisions. Much like hygienic people and places appear more trustworthy, data maintains integrity through proactive governance versus accumulating haphazardly. 

Beyond accuracy, data hygiene powers reuse across teams preventing localized hoarding. It also builds stakeholder confidence data reflects reality reliably informing business direction. Well governed data products become strategic assets differentiating competitive value. **The business necessity for governance skyrockets as data volume, team size and analytical complexity outgrows manual checks.**

# Why Practice Data Hygiene? 

With data underpinning business intelligence, why does hygiene matter? How exactly does poor discipline impact organizations? Consequences span:
  
**Inaccurate reporting** skewing operational visibility:

- Revenue discrepancies  
- Distorted web traffic  
- Flawed customer counts    
- Misleading sales figures

**Unreliable analytics** eroding decision confidence:

- Sampling errors
- Modeling on false inputs   
- Reporting errors compounding   

**Non-compliance** heightening cybersecurity/legal risks:  

- GDPR violations
- PII leaks  
- Financial fraud
- Cyber threats

**Inefficient workflows** hampering productivity:

- Manual verification  
- Debate over metrics
- Duplicate data reconciliation  
- Unstructured repositories

**Lack of reuse** preventing single source of truth:

- Spreadsheet sprawl
- Rogue databases  
- Hidden data dictionaries
- Tribal knowledge silos

**Stakeholder frustration** breeding distrust in insights:  

- Leadership skepticism 
- Domain confusion
- Alarm fatigue 
- Obscured operational reality


Without ongoing hygiene, persisting data decay sparks existential threats - externally through cyber breaches and fines or internally via skewed strategy detached from market dynamics.

# 7 Data Hygiene Best Practices

Combating entropy around accuracy, continuity and accessibility requires proactive governance through stewarding. Core disciplines ensuring fitness include:


| Practice | Description |
| - | - |
|**Standardization** | Establish company-wide protocols for metadata, definitions, values, structures across collection tools.|
| **Monitoring** | Continuously check for errors, anomalies, outliers, missing values during pipelines.|   
| **Validation** | Verify accuracy via secondary sources, sanity checks, subject matter expert reviews. |
| **Deduplication** | Remove redundant duplicates contaminating integrity through merge/purge processes. |   
| **Documentation**   | Catalog meaning, relationships, lineage across systems in a central knowledge base.|
| **Enrichment** | Augment internal data with external signals providing context aiding analysis.|
| **Security** | Manage stringent access controls and encryption safeguarding from breach threats.|

Operationalizing requires technology infrastructure like data catalogs, quality testing suites, master data management platforms, data observability tools measuring trust factors, metadata repositories and pipeline orchestrators. But tools alone cannot fix indifference around discipline - culture prioritizes as the driving force. 

With maturing governance minimizing bad data incidence, analytics productivity and business continuity strengthens allowing innovation on reliable information foundations. Think prevention over periodic cure.

# How to Implement CRM Data Hygiene  

Many organizations capture troves of customer interactions within CRM platforms. But contact records deteriorate through duplicate duplication, flawed segmentation and missing values without oversight. What techniques ensure CRM health?

**1. Establish a Master Data Foundation**  

Consolidate customer profiles into a **single source of truth** within the CRM or a separate specialized Master Data Management (MDM) system. This provides the reference record sourcing downstream duplicates.  

**2. Uniquely Identify Records**  

Implement unique identifiers like enterprise customer numbers to tag records consistently facilitating merging fractures across engagement history. 

**3. Set Update Rules**   

Configure business logic identifying record changes needing review when updated in systems. For example, alert on job title modifications. 

**4. Act on Duplicates**

run **merge/purge processes** identifying duplicate contacts or accounts to collapse while preserving entire engagement history. 

**5. Structure Relevant Attributes** 

Rationalize fields to specific use cases on a need-to-know basis. Remove unused attributes cluttering views.  

**6. Clean at Data Entry**

Setup **input validation rules** preventing bad data submission like invalid email addresses or incorrect zip codes.

**7. Inform Data Governance Policies**  

Compile master guidelines overseeing management, security and quality codifying disciplines.

| Activity | Method | Frequency | Owner |  
| - | - | - | - |
| Duplicate identification | Match similarity rules | Weekly | Data team |
| Accuracy checks | Sample audits | Quarterly | Domain stewards | 
| Issue monitoring | Data quality KPI dashboard | Daily | Data team |

Governance workflows perpetually uphold credibility as personnel and systems evolve.

# Get Started With Data Hygiene 

Where to begin cultivating sustainable hygiene practices? Start small before expanding maturity:  

**Standardize definitions** codifying specific metrics like customer lifetime value or product return rate. 

**Fix unstructured data** by migrating scattered files or sheets into normalized databases with integrity checks. 

**Merge duplicates** within critical systems like CRM to create proprietary master records. 

**Obtain leadership buy-in** for data quality investment by showcasing consequences from inaccurate reporting. 

**Pilot governance additions** minimally before demanding enterprise overhaul. For example, implement a single source of truth customer master.

**Institutionalize via policy** to forcefully upgrade behaviors around collecting, handling and trusting data. 

**Celebrate milestones** like perfect census completion or extracting a single customer view to positively reinforce governance adoption across teams.
 
Gradually earning trust around information stewardship pays dividends as data infrastructure and analytics matures in sophistication. Act now before bad behaviors cement permanently risking lasting drag.

>Data hygiene sets apart truly enlightened organizations. While initially thankless, dedicating resources toward reliable data foundations differentiates market visibility. With analytics essential for guidance, can you afford poor quality threatening clarity on reality? Establish a hygienic analytics culture now. The future favors the precise!
